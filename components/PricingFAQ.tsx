    question: "How is the billing cycle managed?",
    answer: "Our billing is flexible. You can choose between monthly or yearly billing cycles. Yearly plans offer a significant discount of up to 20% compared to the monthly subscription rate."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I upgrade or downgrade my plan at any time?",
    answer: "Yes, you can change your plan at any point through your dashboard. When upgrading, the new features and limits will be available immediately, and your billing will be adjusted proportionally for the remainder of the cycle."
  },
  {
    question: "What are the project-based tokens?",
    answer: "Tokens are used to power advanced AI analysis and automation tasks within your projects. Each plan includes a base number of tokens, and you can easily purchase top-ups if your project requirements scale unexpectedly."
  },

    question: "Do you offer custom enterprise pricing?",
